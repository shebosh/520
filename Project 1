sample_text= """In this assignment, you will write a personal narrative that shares an experience 
from your life and reflects on its significance in order to make it meaningful for 
Mr. readers. Sharing experiences through stories and narratives is fundamental to all 
successful communication. Compelling narratives are crucial to promoting empathy, understanding, 
and action in any persuasive communication. As you prepare for subsequent assignments, you should 
consider how all successful communication, even when based on our personal experiences and 
perspectives, is ultimately a dialogue with others.
